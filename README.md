# OpenGL House
This project was my submission for the [final project in CS370](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs370-fall2019/assign/project.html),  
developed over the course of a little less than three weeks.  

This project is an interactive scene of a house rendered in OpenGL. It's essentially  
a small 3D renderer since all of the assets are loaded and added into the render  
system.
